This app will hopefully be a highly effective job application website where a company can post a job; and a User can apply to those jobs
 and also create/read/update/delete their job applications for a company. 
This app will also be able to create questions from the user and also get those questions answered by the company directly. So that 
    the users can have a better understanding of the job position and speak to the company directly. 
The point is to create better transparence between employee and employer.

My models will be Company, User, Question, Answer
