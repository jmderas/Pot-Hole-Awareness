This website will be used for assisting the day-to-day D.C street driver, by allowing them to see real-time posts of potholes in their area. 
My website will allow users to annymonusly report a pot-hole in the streets and upload pictures of them to help drivers avoid damage to their vehicle thus making the citizens of the District of Columbia safer and notifying the government of street repairs.
